Main objective of the assignment is to build classifier for 3 species of plants (iris) dataset which is widely recognized as one of classic benchmark problems in this field. Following classifier architecture are implemented:
    1. KNN classifier
    2. Fisherâ€™s linear discriminator. 3 classifiers for 2-class problems (binary: one vs others) classifying one class
    against the other two. You may also be interested to seek information about the Multi-class Linear
    Discriminant Analysis in the literature.
